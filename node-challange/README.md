# Splyt node challange 1

## Background
Write a function defaultArguments . It takes a function as an argument, along with an object
containing default values for that function's arguments, and returns another function which defaults to the
right values.

## Dependencies
Since EcamScript decorators are still in Stage 2 they are not production ready. Hence why we use an 3rd party library to parse function and construct a new one.

## Installation
* Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
* edit assertedFunction.js and add your own. 


* Run test
```
npm install
```
